#v4.1.0

* Make the project compatible with Symfony 6.0
* Test multiple versions of PHP and Symfony in CI
* **Potential BC break**: change minimum required Symfony versions to 5.3 instead of 5.0 (please upgrade ðŸ˜‰).

# v4.0.1

* Make the project compatible with Symfony 5.4
* Make the project compatible with PHP up to 8.1

# v4.0.0

### Breaking changes

* All service defintions now use class names instead of old-styled names. You might have to change your Dependency Injection if you inject CmsBundle's services by their name.
* Added default validation constraints for Page and Category entities. This might break your app if you pass Page or Category entities through Symfony Forms.
* Removed `Category::$createdAt`, didn't really make sense.
* Replaced `DateTime` with `DateTimeImmutable` in the `Page` entity.

### Other changes:

* Symfony 5.0 is now required
* PHP 7.3+ is required
* Added a PostsController to use Page objects like blog posts with date in URL (#25)
* Use Symfony/String instead of Behat/Transliterator as a slugger
* Made setters accept null as argument, for flexibility with how the Form component usually works

### Major changes and BC breaks

- Now, you must create your own `Page` and `Category` entities and configure them in the bundle, which is much better when you need to override them.
- Remove Gedmo doctrine behaviors: you have to implement them yourself if you need them.
- You can use your own repositories, but Orbitale's controllers use a specific one configured as a service. By the way, your repos can extend this one if you want.
- Make the bundle require php 5.4 (hey, we're in 2016!)

# v2.0.0

- Make config more strict & light for injections
- Remove `createdAt` setters and fix category slug update
- Fixed tests
- Make the bundle require php 5.4 (hey, we're in 2016!)
- Update docs to add warning about `1.x` and `master` branches

# v1.6.1

- Fix tag parameter injection (closes #7)

# v2.0.0

Now, you must create your own `Page` and `Category` entities, which is much better when you need to override them.
- Remove entities Gedmo dependencies and make them abstract
- Update config for new Page and Category classes
- Remove Gedmo services from configuration
- Create a listener to update mapped superclasses mapping (else it'd be "illegal" according to doctrine)
- Remove `updatedAt` sortable field in Category controller
- Update repositories so they use the correct classes
- Updated tests
- Fixed dependencies
- Update readme

# v1.6.0

- Make doctrine connection configurable under the `orbitale_cms.connection` parameter

# v1.5.1

### Fixes

- Redirect homepage with locale if has one only

### Minor adjustments

- Remove dead code
- Remove whitespaces in readme
- Fix tests
- Update dependencies and CI
- Update LICENSE date

# v1.5.0

### New features

- Add Doctrine Cache support for the bundle (@sfarkas1988)

# v1.4.1

- Some minor fixes, but now the bundle is compatible with Symfony3 ! :tada: 

# v1.4.0

In order to allow this bundle to migrate to Symfony 2.8, it now requires `twig/twig: ~1.23` because of the new `Twig_Extension_GlobalsInterface` class that must be extended by any extension requiring the use of `getGlobals()`.

This induces a small BC break for all apps requiring Twig with an inferior version.

- Minor update for Symfony 2.8 and 3.0

# v1.3.3

### Fixes

- Fix reversed breadcrumbs on page index

### Tests & CI

- Fixed PageControllerTest
- Fix travis-ci config to build only master

# v1.3.2

### Code style

- Minor change in code style (mostly for SensioLabsInsight & ScrutinizerCI)

# v1.3.1

- Fix bug in test after new default breadcrumb class in config
